Postal Location Decoder

This project was a Programming challenge where I needed to write a program that could decript postal ID codes (zip codes) and turn get the citys from them.  I went a step further and got the states as well.

For this project I used the USPS Web Tools interface to retrieve the nessessary data.

As it stands, any list of valid post codes.  If a zip code isn't reconized, its place in the returned list states that it is an invalid code.  The others pas through just fine.
